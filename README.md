# opencv_example
This bot
- is inspired by https://github.com/kioltk/wow-fishipy
- uses image diff to guess where the fishing float is (works almost always)
- uses sound output to determine if a fish is hooked (works 80%)

# pre-requisites
1. install portaudio
```
brew install portaudio
```

2. need to connect microphone input to PC sound output
- I use this one https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/

3. since it uses image diff, a large float is required. It can be bought from fishing merchants.
